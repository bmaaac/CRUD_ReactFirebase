# simple CRUD app with Firebase
Link: https://bmaaac.github.io/crud_reactfirebase/

In this project, I developed a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with Firebase Realtime Database as the backend. Firebase Realtime Database offers a flexible, scalable solution for storing and syncing data in real-time, making it ideal for web or mobile applications requiring instant updates.

Overall, this project provided a solid foundation in integrating a cloud-based backend with the use of bootstrap as a front-end framework, handling real-time data, and ensuring security, all of which are essential skills for advanced web development.
